### Hi ✌🏻

<p>I'm a clinical psychologist interested in building web applications with a focus on server-side & databases.</p>

<p>To do so, I started learning PHP, SQL, and Apache Server.</p>

<p>So far, I have created several front-end apps that you can find in my <a href="https://victoriayats.github.io/">portfolio</a>.</p>
